ðŸ”¹ **Practical data insights** â€“ Converting raw numbers into actionable insights to help businesses make informed decisions.  
ðŸ”¹ **Technical skills that get things done** â€“ SQL, Python, R, SAS, Tableau, and AWS for managing, analyzing, and visualizing data.  
ðŸ”¹ **Business + psychology perspective** â€“ Merging an understanding of human behavior with a focus on business priorities.  
ðŸ”¹ **Clear and effective communication** â€“ Explaining complex concepts in clear, relatable terms.

I am passionate about making data usable. My bachelorâ€™s in psychology gave me an initial understanding of research into human behavior, but marketing took all those behavioral insights and applied themâ€”helping businesses attract attention, create emotional connections, and become memorable. Seeing the power of applied research inspired me to pursue this path.

To further develop my analytical and business expertise, I pursued an MS in Business Analytics. I strengthened my skills in statistics, data management, and visualization while gaining hands-on experience with SQL, Python, R, and AWSâ€”learning to store, process, and analyze data in both local and cloud environments.

Beyond technical skills, Iâ€™ve refined my ability to interpret the context behind data, enabling me to ask better questions and derive more impactful recommendations. I built on my undergraduate foundation in Psychology and Business Administration by taking courses in consumer behavior, social media analytics, data mining, and communication.

I thrive as a bridge between technical teams and business stakeholders, leveraging my dual background in data and business to drive informed decision-making. Iâ€™m seeking opportunities where I can apply these skills to help organizations harness data for smarter strategies.
