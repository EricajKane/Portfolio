## Product Management Analytics Project
Developed a comprehensive framework for an analytics project addressing the pain points and opportunities faced by a product manager in a pseudo-Amazon company. Outlined key performance indicators (KPIs), identified required datasets, and proposed statistical models. Additionally, created a dashboard wireframe to highlight the KPIs for evaluating the success of the analytics project and its impact on company-wide goals.
